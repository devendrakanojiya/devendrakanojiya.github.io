As a student (Ritika ,Giriraj , Shagun) analysed the market well. The market pretty crowded. We took an interview of an shop owner.The owner  of smartphone shop in kongaon .They provide us proper information about our presentation topic ie about his business. The  location of the shop was good! and the people's around the shop belongs to business background. It we talk about own personal experience, we were experiencing that were the employees of any organisation and doing some was future marketing or survey job. In the end it a good future upcomings.
